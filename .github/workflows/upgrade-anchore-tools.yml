            This is an auto-generated pull request to upgrade to [Syft ${{ env.syft_v }}](https://github.com/anchore/syft/releases/tag/${{ env.syft_v }}).

            **Do not commit to this branch.**

            - The GitHub Action will force-push over your commits the next time it runs.
            - If the Syft upgrade is safe as-is (manual and automated tests pass), go ahead and approve + merge.
            - If production or test code must be updated, do so in a separate branch.
            - Run `make upgrade-syft` to apply the same change the GitHub Action is performing.
