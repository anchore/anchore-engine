(CVE-2017-7502) Bug Fix(es): * The Network Security Services (NSS) code and Certificate Authority (CA) list have been updated to meet the recommendations as published with the latest Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR). The updated CA list improves compatibility with the certificates that are used in the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). To avoid certificate validation refusals, Red Hat recommends installing the updated CA list on June 12, 2017. (BZ#1451421)", "Name": "RHSA-2017:1365"}}]
