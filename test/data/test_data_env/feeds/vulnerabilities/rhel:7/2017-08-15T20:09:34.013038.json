Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788) * It was discovered that the use of httpd's ap_get_basic_auth_pw() API function outside of the authentication phase could lead to authentication bypass. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass required authentication if the API was used incorrectly by one of the modules used by httpd. (CVE-2017-3167) * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's mod_ssl module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an httpd child process to crash if another module used by httpd called a certain API function during the processing of an HTTPS request. (CVE-2017-3169) * A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's ap_find_token() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash via a specially crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2017-7668) * A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's mod_mime module. A user permitted to modify httpd's MIME configuration could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-7679)", "Name": "RHSA-2017:2479"}}]
