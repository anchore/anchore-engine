[{"Vulnerability": {"Severity": "High", "NamespaceName": "rhel:7", "FixedIn": [{"VersionFormat": "rpm", "NamespaceName": "rhel:7", "Version": "0:0.2.0-38.el7_3", "Name": "rpcbind"}], "Link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1262", "Description": "The rpcbind utility is a server that converts Remote Procedure Call (RPC) program numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on the host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine. Security Fix(es): * It was found that due to the way rpcbind uses libtirpc (libntirpc), a memory leak can occur when parsing specially crafted XDR messages. An attacker sending thousands of messages to rpcbind could cause its memory usage to grow without bound, eventually causing it to be terminated by the OOM killer. (CVE-2017-8779)", "Name": "RHSA-2017:1262"}}]
