#
#  IMPORTANT NOTE - for anchore-engine 0.4.0 and latest, we have moved
#  to a new docker-compose method and approach for deploying
#  anchore-engine with docker-compose, which more accurately reflects
#  production deployment setups.
#
#  Please refer to the latest documentation for running anchore-engine
#  with docker-compose:
#
#  https://docs.anchore.com/current/docs/engine/engine_installation/docker_compose/
#
#  The following docker-compose.yaml has been altered to reference the
#  latest 0.3 series release of anchore-engine for continuity, but
#  note that both this and the associated config.yaml in this
#  directory will be removed in the future.
