## Anchore Engine 0.9.0

Anchore Engine 0.9.0, features, bug fixes, and improvements.  The latest summary can always be found in the Anchore Engine [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) on github.

*NOTE: this release does involve a database schema update including column updates for some tables that may be quite large for some deployments, schedule
downtime appropriately as it may take minutes to an hour depending on your database size and number of images you've analyzed and are present in the DB*

Engine 0.9.0 begins the migration of image inspection and vulnerability scanning to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/Syft) and [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/Grype) tools
which allow re-use of that logic outside of a deployed stateful system. Engine now consumes Syft internally for generating container bills-of-materials for all
OS and application packages.

### New API Revision

The API is updated to version [0.1.16](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/blob/v0.9.0/anchore_engine/services/apiext/swagger/swagger.yaml)

### Update to Python Version

Engine 0.9.0 is built and tested against Python 3.8, and that is what is installed in the container image as well. Previous release used Python 3.6.
