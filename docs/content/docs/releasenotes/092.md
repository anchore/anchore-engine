## Anchore Engine 0.9.2

Anchore Engine 0.9.2 bug fixes, and improvements.  The latest summary can always be found in the Anchore Engine [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) on github.

## Changes of Note

### Fixed
+ Updates included version of syft to 0.13.1 to include new 'relationships' feature in syft to allow filtering out application packages that are "owned" by OS distro packages. 
  This will ensure that the correct versions and vulnerability sources are used for matches. For example, if an RPM installs a python egg, the python egg is detected to be owned by the RPM (because its files are all part of the rpm), and so it will be filtered out and
  only the RPM name and version reported. This will remove a lot of false-positive vulnerability matches based on the application packages that had incorrect versions because only the distro package versions are updated by maintainers.
+ Fixes analysis failures due to unexpected package manifest content. Fixes #910
