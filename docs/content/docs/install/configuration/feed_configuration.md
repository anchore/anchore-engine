### Feed Synchronization Interval

The default configuration for the Anchore Engine will download vulnerability data from Anchore's feed service every 21,600 seconds (6hours).

For most users the only configuration option that is typically updated is the feed synchronization interval - the time interval (in seconds) at which the feed sync is run.

```policy_engine:
    .....
    
    cycle_timers:
      ...
      feed_sync: 14400
```

### Feed Settings

Feed sync configuration is set in the config.yaml file used by policy engine service. The `feeds` section of the configuration file in the policy engine's container controls the behavior of feed syncs done by that particular container. Ensure these are synchronized between
containers if you are running more than one policy engine. This is usually handled for you by Helm Charts on Kubernetes, for example.

The Anchore Engine will default to downloading feed data from Anchore's feed service hosted at https://ancho.re/v1/service/feeds and running in AWS in the us-west-2 region.


By default the Anchore Engine will perform a selective sync enabling only the vulnerabilities feed. Setting the (selective_sync) enabled flag to false, or updating the other feed types to True will enable synchronization of the specified feed.

```
feeds:
  selective_sync:
    # If enabled only sync specific feeds instead of all.
    enabled: True
    feeds:
      vulnerabilities: True
      packages: False
      nvdv2: True
      github: True  
  url: 'https://ancho.re/v1/service/feeds'  
  connection_timeout_seconds: 3
  read_timeout_seconds: 60
```

***Note:*** Engine now has a new feed for Grype. This feed will only be synced if the
[tech preview Grype vulnerability scanner]({{< ref "/docs/grype/_index" >}}) is enabled. Furthermore, if it is
enabled this will be the only feed that Engine syncs, as it replaces (and contains vulnerability data from)
the other groups.

#### Read Timeout

Under rare circumstances you may see syncs failing with errors to fetch data due to timeouts. This is typically due to load on the feed service, network issues, or
some other temporary condition. However, if you want to increase the timeout to increate the likelihood of success, modify the _read_timeout_seconds_ of the feeds configuration:

```
feeds:
  ...
  read_timeout_seconds: 180
```

### Controlling Which Feeds and Groups are Synced

Note: The package and nvd data feeds are large, resulting in the initial sync taking some time time.

During initial feed sync, you can always query the progress and status of the feed sync using the anchore-cli.

```

```

***Note:*** If the tech preview Grype vulnerability scanner is enabled, the Grype feed is the only feed that will be synced. It will
contain the records from all the other groups. It is not possible to include or exclude groups from the Grype feed.

### Using the Config File to Include/Exclude Feeds at System Bootstrap

The most common way to set which feeds are synced is in the config.yaml for the policy engine. By default, 
the _vulnerabilities_, _nvdv2_, and _github_ feeds are synced to provide good vulnerability matching support for a variety of linux distros
and application package types. Normally it will not be necessary to modify that set.

To disable a feed or enable a disabled feed, modify the config.yaml's _feeds_ section to:

```
feeds:
  selective_sync: 
    enabled: true
    feeds:
      vulnerabilities: true
      nvdv2: true
      github: true
      packages: false
```

Those boolean values can be used to enable/disable the feeds. Note that changes will require a restart of the policy engine to take effect and settng
a feed to 'false' will not remove any data or show in the API/CLI, it will simply skip updates during sync operations.


### Using the CLI to Configure Feeds


#### Disabling an Entire Feed

An entire feed can be disabled. This means that all the feed's groups will no longer be updated and no new groups will be synced either on subsequent sync operations.
This does not, however, remove any existing data nor will it remove the feed or feed group metadata records.

Example:
```
[anchore@93d6977e2061 anchore-engine]$ anchore-cli system feeds config github --disable
Feed                    Group                  LastSync                          RecordCount        
github(disabled)        github:composer        2020-03-27T22:19:57.328440        78                 
github(disabled)        github:gem             2020-03-27T22:19:59.069349        333                
github(disabled)        github:java            2020-03-27T22:20:03.393652        432                
github(disabled)        github:npm             2020-03-27T22:20:09.422600        653                
github(disabled)        github:nuget           2020-03-27T22:20:16.628054        50                 
github(disabled)        github:python          2020-03-27T22:20:17.754270        250      
```

The feed can be enabled again using a similar command and on the next sync operation its data will be updated.
Example:
```
[anchore@93d6977e2061 anchore-engine]$ anchore-cli system feeds config github --enable
Feed          Group                  LastSync                          RecordCount

#### Disabling Specific Feed Groups

For a more granular approach, you can disable a single group within a feed.

#### Deleting Specific Feed Groups

```
[anchore@93d6977e2061 ~]$ anchore-cli system feeds config --disable vulnerabilities --group centos:5
Group                     LastSync                          RecordCount

[anchore@93d6977e2061 ~]$ anchore-cli system feeds delete vulnerabilities --group centos:5

centos:5(disabled)        pending         0         
```


#### Restoring Deleted Data

If you want to get data back, simply enable the feed and/or group and run a feed sync manually or wait for the next scheduled sync.


For an entire feed, here is an example of removal and re-adding it:
```
[anchore@93d6977e2061 ~]$ anchore-cli system feeds config github --disable

For a single feed group, here is an example of removal and re-adding it:

```
[anchore@93d6977e2061 ~]$ anchore-cli system feeds config --enable vulnerabilities --group centos:5
Group           LastSync        RecordCount        
centos:5        pending         0                  

[anchore@93d6977e2061 ~]$ anchore-cli system feeds sync

```

With these controls you can better customize the data set that anchore stores in the db. However, note that this should not normally be necessary
and modifying feed groups & data has implication on the sets of distros and types of artifacts Anchore can match vulnerabilities against.
