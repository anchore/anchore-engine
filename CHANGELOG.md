## 0.3.0 (2018-11-15)

NOTE: For users upgrading from 0.2.X to 0.3.X, please note that the upgrade process may take some time for deployments anchore-engine that have a large number of images stored (many thousands).  Please review the upgrade guide (https://anchore.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/36000052927-upgrading-anchore-engine) to safely plan for an upgrade, and plan for a longer service maintainence window than usual for this upgrade if your engine has a large number of images analyzed.

+ Major Version Update - anchore-engine and anchore-cli ported to Python3!
+ New Feature - Multi-user API and Structure
  + Adds user management and detection API routes: /accounts/*, /account, /user
  + New option in config.yaml for the "apiext" service: "authorization_handler" key, with default value "native". Allows extension point for other models in the future.

  + During upgrade, existing users are migrated to accounts of the same name with user records with the same credentials.
  + Adds 'x-anchore-account' header support to allow admin users to make requests in the namespace of other accounts, for example to view events or image status, without requiring api route changes.
  + The existing config.yaml user sections are respected during first system initialization but ignored afterwards, so user management is purely via the APIs.
+ New Feature - Security-first Queries and Reports
  + Query for a list of images affected by input Vulnerability ID
  + Query for a list of images with an input package installed
  + Query for record information about a specific Vulnerability by ID

+ Added - unauthenticated API route /version to retrieve service version information
+ Added - optional skopeo_global_timeout setting (seconds) for config.yaml which will be passed through to skopeo calls as the command-timeout option
+ Added - ability to ask for interactive (DB side effect free) policy evaluation via interactive=<true|false> query parameter to /v1/image/<image>/check route
+ Improved - java artifact manifest file parsing support and implementation (contributions by Matt Sicker <boards@gmail.com>)
+ Improved - add bootstrap process retries to improve behavior of simultaneous startup of distributed anchore-engine services
+ Improved - normalize all package database record handling for OS and Non-OS (NPM, GEM, Java, Python, etc) packages
+ Improved - better error passthrough from internal services (catalog/policy engine) back through external API to user (400, 404 instead of 500)
+ Improved - more consistent logging during bootstrap, throughout
+ Changed - move from CentOS to Ubuntu base image for anchore-engine containers
+ Removed - deprecated 'prune' routes and operations
