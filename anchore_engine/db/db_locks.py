"""
Module for using db-based leases. These are implemented in db-agnostic ways so should be portable (e.g. not using postgresql advisory leases).

The general model for a DbLock that a lease is an entity in the db with an owner and a timeout that is updated with CAS operations.

These are *not* high performance leases and should not be used for anything that is either high frequency or requires very hard exclusion requirements since
this model uses lease timeouts to ensure that leases are released eventually in cases of process crashes or lost network connectivity.

These leases are re-entrant and not incrementing, so a single release() will release the lease regardless of number of acquire() calls by the owner.
